      <h2>Portable Appliance Testing ( P.A.T )</h2>
      <p>What is Portable Appliance Testing ? <br><br>

        Portable Appliance Testing, also known as PAT testing is simply
         the testing of electrical equipment to ensure that it is safe to use.
          Portable equipment is classed as a piece of equipment that is powered
           from the mains electricity supply via a cable and plug. It does not mean
            that the equipment has to be moveable, but has to be moveable without being unwired. <br><br>
        
        Is PAT testing a compulsory or legal requirement ?<br><br>
        
        No. The following is taken from the HSE website ( http://www.hse.gov.uk/electricity/faq-portable-appliance-testing.htm ) :-
        
        "The law simply requires an employer to ensure that their
         electrical equipment is maintained in order to prevent danger.
          It does not say how this should be done or how often. Employers should take
           a risk-based approach, considering the type of equipment and what it is being used for. If it is 
           used regularly and moved a lot e.g. a floor cleaner or a kettle, testing (along with visual checks)
            can be an important part of an effective maintenance regime giving employers confidence that they are
             doing what is necessary to help them meet their legal duties. HSE provides guidance on how to maintain equipment including the use of PAT."<br><br>
        
        Do I need to get an Electrician to carry out my PAT testing ?<br><br>
        
        No.  The person doing testing work needs to competent to do it.
         In many low-risk environments, a sensible (competent) member of staff can 
         undertake visual inspections if they have enough knowledge and training. 
         However, when undertaking combined inspection and testing, a greater level
          of knowledge and experience is needed, and the person will need: <br><br>
        
        the right equipment to do the tests
        the ability to use this test equipment properly
        the ability to properly understand the test results
        Will the testing cause a great disruption ?<br><br>
        
        No. At NA Electrical we will try to ensure that the minimum amount of disruption
         is caused. We can arrange to carry out your testing during quiet times of the day, during evenings, nights or at weekends. <br><br>
        
        How often do I have to get my equipment tested ?<br><br>
        
        This is totally dependent on the environment in which the equipment is used.
         If this is low risk then a full inspection and test may be done every 2 years.
          If the equipment is used everyday then it may be prevalent to have it tested every year or sooner. <br><br>
        
        Is PAT testing expensive ? <br><br>
        
        We have a sliding scale of costs per item, with a minimum charge of £30 +vat.
         The more items you have that require testing, the less per item you will have to pay. <br><br>
